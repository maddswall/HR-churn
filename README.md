## Project Overview
In our capstone class, we employed Agile methodologies to structure a project focused on incorporating predictive analytics and machine learning into HR data analysis for XYZ. As the technical lead, I guided our team through the process.

## Agile Methodology
Agile Components Used:
- Vision Statement
- Product Backlog
- Burndown Charts
- Retrospectives
- Agile Reports

## Project Goals
#### Integrate, Clean, and Analyze Employee Data:
We refined column names, dropped irrelevant rows, edited for clarity, engineered features, sanity-checked data, encoded categorical features, performed Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), created data frames, and converted the data to CSV format.

#### Improve Efficiency and Repeatability:
We aimed to enhance the data analysis process within XYZ's HR department by applying predictive analytics and machine learning techniques.

#### Predictive Analytics:
We applied predictive analytics to identify key drivers of voluntary employee churn, such as specific job roles or work conditions.

## Machine Learning Implementation
#### Data Preparation:
Split the data into training and test sets.

#### Model Testing:
We evaluated five different models: Gradient Boosting Classifier, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest Classifier, Extreme Gradient Boosting Classifier, and Logistic Regression.

#### Model Evaluation:
We used accuracy, F1 score, and AUC to determine the best-performing model.

#### Churn Prediction:
The selected model was used to predict voluntary churn, calculating a churn probability for each employee to identify those most likely to leave (e.g., onsite engineers).
